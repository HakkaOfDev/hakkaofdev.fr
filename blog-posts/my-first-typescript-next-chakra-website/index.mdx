# At the beginning

Where does this idea come from, why do we have to do it? I asked myself a lot of questions
and watched a lot of videos in order to realize my projects and it's thanks to them that I
was able to learn how to start with [Next](https://nextjs.org/) and how to use [Chakra](https://chakra-ui.com/), a beautiful library straight
out of the future.

# Explanation

First of all I went on Youtube and I found [@devaslife](https://www.youtube.com/c/devaslife) who made his portfolio with Chakra-UI in Javascript,
so I tried to understand and reproduce it to produce a satisfactory result. So I created a website in javascript (you can find it here: [Flonoa Homepage](https://www.github.com/hakkaofdev/flonoa.fr)). I come from JAVA, I'm used to typed variables, so I was looking for my way in this big world that is web development.
Then I searched and found a typescript template and went for it [frontend-horse-ui](https://github.com/nikolovlazar/frontend-horse-ui). I directly fell in love with Chakra, its hooks, its content, the way it works, especially its [discord community](https://chakra-ui.com/discord) with which I work and help daily when I can.

Here an example how to render 404 page in Chakra:

```typescript
import NextLink from 'next/link'; // NextLink import
import { Box, Button, Divider, Heading, Text } from '@chakra-ui/react'; // Chakra component imports

const NotFoundPage = () => {
  return (
    <Layout title='Not Found'>
      <Section delay={0.3}>
        <Heading as='h1'>Not Found</Heading>
        <Text>The page you&apos;re looking for was not found.</Text>
        <Divider my={6} />

        <Box my={6} align='center'>
          <NextLink href='/'>
            <Button colorScheme='pink'>Return to home</Button>
          </NextLink>
        </Box>
      </Section>
    </Layout>
  );
};

export default NotFoundPage;
```

It's beautiful because you've the control on your components. `<Heading>` component will refer to `<h1>` in HTML and you can customize it as you wish.
That's not all, Chakra-UI uses [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for these animated components (`Fade`, `ScaleFade`, `Slide`, `SlideFade`, `Collapse`).
So I also fell in love with motion which is simply amazing especially mixed with Chakra, let's see an example of a `ThemeButton` with `IconButton` chakra-component with `motion()`:

```typescript
import {
  IconButton,
  IconButtonProps,
  useColorMode,
  useColorModeValue as mode,
} from '@chakra-ui/react';Ã˜
import { BsMoon } from 'react-iconsbs';
import { WiDaySunny } from 'react-icons/wi';
import { AnimatePresence, motion, Variants } from 'framer-motion';

//declaration of animation variants
const variants: Variants = {
  initial: {
    y: -20,
    opacity: 0,
    transition: {
      type: 'spring',
      duration: 0.2,
    },
  },
  animate: {
    y: 0,
    opacity: 1,
    transition: {
      type: 'spring',
      duration: 0.2,
    },
  },
  exit: {
    y: 20,
    opacity: 0,
    transition: {
      type: 'spring',
      duration: 0.2,
    },
  },
};

// button component
const ThemeButton = () => {
  const { toggleColorMode } = useColorMode(); // hook for change colormode
  const MotionButton = motion<IconButtonProps>(IconButton); // declaration for the IconButton component with props of a motion

  return (
    <AnimatePresence exitBeforeEnter initial={false}>
      <MotionButton
        variants={variants}
        initial='initial'
        animate='animate'
        exit='exit'
        aria-label='Toggle theme'
        colorScheme={mode('purple', 'orange')}
        icon={mode(<BsMoon />, <WiDaySunny />)}
        onClick={toggleColorMode}
      />
    </AnimatePresence>
  );
};

export default ThemeButton;
```

So you can see the `MotionButton` have the props of `IconButton` but also the props of a `motion` component.<br/>
It's beautiful ! Isn't ?

# Conclusion

I was very patient, demanding, and on the lookout for everything related to `Chakra-UI`. I've read all the docs, check the source code and I would like to become a `Collaborator` to Chakra-UI.
Never give up on your dreams, `perseverance` is the key to success. Never forget that.
