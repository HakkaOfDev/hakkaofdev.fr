# What is this special event ?

The [HackSecuReims](https://www.hacksecureims.eu) organized a special event which called `a CTF` (type Jeopardy) but what's it ?
>   Jeopardy-style CTFs present competitors with a set of questions that reveal clues that guide them in solving complex tasks in a specific order. By revealing clues, contestants learn the right direction regarding techniques and methodologies that are needed going forward.

# My team

With my brothers [Alexis LEBEL](https://github.com/Alestrio) and [Corentin FREIRE](https://github.com/PtitNost), we've participed to this event with name `Peignoir'Bros` and we came dressed in `bathrobes`.

**BECAUSE WE LOVE BATHROBES.**

# Atmoshpere

In the room, we were about sixty may be seventy and seperated in team of 3 in table with 6blocks. We helped each other for the most hardest levels, and we've the opportunities to discuss with em and others like organizers.

# Challenges

The most interessant part because it's the heart of CTF. From scanning a qrcode to get a flag to writing a program in rust, this CTF have a huge panel of challenges.
I'll expose you twos of em'.

First the `GIF problem`.
You have a GIF with a sequence of +1000 frames which itself represents a qrcode. Each frame, when you scanned her, give you one letter from a base64 code which I've to decode him to get the flag. But to have the correct code, I was not going to scan every single frames. So I automatised the code with Python.

```python
from os import listdir
from PIL import Image
from pyzbar.pyzbar import decode

def get_index(x): #function to sort the list of images
  return(x[6:10])

message = ''
gifs = sorted(listdir('/home/hakka/Downloads/gifs/'), key=get_index)

for gif in gifs:
  message += decode(Image.open(f'/home/hakka/Downloads/gifs/{gif}'))[0].data.decode('utf-8')

print(message)
```
So when this script was executed, he returned to me the base 64 code, so I went to [Base 64 Decoder](https://www.base64decode.org/) to decode it and get the flag.

The second one was the `OCR Reload`.
It was my first approach with OCRs. I spent 3 hours on it ahah but I was happy to pass it.
> But what is OCR ?
> Optical character recognition or optical character reader is the electronic or mechanical conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene-photo or from subtitle text superimposed on an image.

I programmed twos differents codes to pass this challenge. First is with [pytesseract](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/) whichis specialized in OCR.
```python
from os import listdir
from PIL import Image
import pytesseract

def get_index(x): #function to sort the list of images
  return(x[6:1O])

message = ''
imgs = sorted(listdir('/home/hakka/Downloads/imgs/'), key=get_index)
config = r'--oem 3 --psm 10' #config needed to OCR
for img in imgs:
  im = Image.open(f'/home/hakka/Downloads/imgs/{img}')
  character = pytesseract.image_to_string(im, config=config)
  message += stri.strip()[0]

print(message)
```
The first one worked almost to the excpetion of 2-3 characters that were fighting, so I decided to retry with an another method.

The second one is with the hashes of images. For example if imgs folder contains 2 imgs with a inside, they'll have the same hashes. So I created a code to compare the hashes of images and I stored them in a dict.
For doing that, I used [ImageHash](https://pypi.org/project/ImageHash/)
```python
from os import listdir
from PIL import Image
import imagehash

def get_index(x):
  return(x[6:10])

hashes = {} # ex {'a': 'vreveve33klkn2'} key: character, value: hash
message=''
ims = sorted(listdir('/home/hakka/Downloads/imgs/'), key=get_index)
for img in imgs:
  im = Image.open(f'/home/hakka/Downloads/imgs/{img}')
  im_hash = imagehash.dhash(im) # can use phash too

  if im_hash in hashes.values():
    for key, value in hashes.items():
      if im_hash == value:
        message += key
        break
  else:
    newKey = str(input(f'Enter one key for {img}: '))
    hashes[newKey] = im_hash
    message += newKey

print(message)
```

And it's worked.
The other challenges was cool too and some were unfortunately impossible because I had not the required skillset.

# Conclusion 

Like everyone in this event, I am happy to have been able to participate in such an event. I don't regrets anything.
I'm looking forward to next year's and this time coming back much stronger.

Thanks to all.
